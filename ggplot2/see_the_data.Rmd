## See the data

This is an interactive course for the instructor to discuss and modify the code with the trainee interactively to explore the data.

### Dataset

We use the iris dataset to see how we can use ggplot to understand it.

- Sepal: 萼片
- Petal: 花瓣

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(datasets)
data(iris)
iris
```

### Question: How to see the data completely?

In the below plot, only `Sepal.Length` and `Sepal.Width` are visualized.

Some data attributes are not seen:

- `Petal.Length`
- `Petal.Width`
- `Species`

Also, the points are overlapped. Although alpha is used to reflect the density, it's not easy to tell how many points (from all species) are overlapped.

```{r}
ggplot(iris) + geom_point(aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width), alpha=0.3)
```
