## String Literals

A character, or strings, are used for storing text. A string is surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks:

`"hello"` is the same as `'hello'`:

```{r}
"hello"
'hello'
```

## Assign a String to a Variable

Assigning a string to a variable is done with the variable followed by the `<-` operator and the string:

```{r}
str <- "Hello"
str # print the value of str
```

## Multiline Strings

You can assign a multiline string to a variable like this:

```{r}
str <- "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
consectetur adipiscing elit,
sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt
ut labore et dolore magna aliqua."

str # print the value of str
```

However, note that R will add a "\\n" at the end of each line break. This is called an escape character, and the n character indicates a new line.

If you want the line breaks to be inserted at the same position as in the code, use the `cat()` function:

```{r}
str <- "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
consectetur adipiscing elit,
sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt
ut labore et dolore magna aliqua."

cat(str)
```

## String Length

There are many usesful string functions in R.

For example, to find the number of characters in a string, use the `nchar()` function:

```{r}
str <- "Hello World!"

nchar(str)
```

## Check a String

Use the `grepl()` function to check if a character or a sequence of characters are present in a string:

```{r}
str <- "Hello World!"

grepl("H", str)
grepl("Hello", str)
grepl("X", str)
```

## Combine Two Strings

Use the `paste()` function to merge/concatenate two strings:

```{r}
str1 <- "Hello"
str2 <- "World"

paste(str1, str2)
```

## Escape Characters

To insert characters that are illegal in a string, you must use an escape character.

An escape character is a backslash `\` followed by the character you want to insert.

An example of an illegal character is a double quote inside a string that is surrounded by double quotes:

```{r}
# The below is invalid
# str <- "We are the so-called "Vikings", from the north."
```

To fix this problem, use the escape character `\"`:

```{r}
str <- "We are the so-called \"Vikings\", from the north."

str
cat(str)
```

Note that auto-printing the str variable will print the backslash in the output. You can use the `cat()` function to print it without backslash.

Other escape characters in R:

- `\\` Backslash
- `\n` New Line
- `\r` Carriage Return
- `\t` Tab
- `\b` Backspace
