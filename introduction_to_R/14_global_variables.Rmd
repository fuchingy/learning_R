## Global Variables

Variables that are created outside of a function are known as global variables.

Global variables can be used by everyone, both inside of functions and outside.

```{r}
txt <- "awesome"
my_function <- function() {
  paste("R is", txt)
}

my_function()
```

If you create a variable with the same name inside a function, this variable will be local, and can only be used inside the function. The global variable with the same name will remain as it was, global and with the original value.

```{r}
txt <- "global variable"
my_function <- function() {
  txt = "fantastic"
  paste("R is", txt)
}

my_function()

txt # print txt
```

If you try to print `txt`, it will return "global variable" because we are printing `txt` outside the function.
