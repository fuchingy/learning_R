## Comments

Comments can be used to explain R code, and to make it more readable. It can also be used to prevent execution when testing alternative code.

Comments starts with a `#`. When executing code, R will ignore anything that starts with `#`.

This example uses a comment before a line of code:

```{r}
# This is a comment
"Hello World!"
```

This example uses a comment at the end of a line of code:

```{r}
"Hello World!" # This is a comment
```

Multiline Comments

Unlike other programming languages, such as Java, there are no syntax in R for multiline comments. However, we can just insert a `#` for each line to create multiline comments:

```{r}
# This is a comment
# written in
# more than just one line
"Hello World!"
```
